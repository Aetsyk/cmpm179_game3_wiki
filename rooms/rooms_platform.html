                    <h1>Platform Rooms</h1><hr>

                    <div>
                        <p>Platform Rooms are short platfroming challenges where the player must find the correct platforms
                            to jump to. The challenge comes from the myriad of fake and invisible platforms intended to mess
                            with the player.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Color Platforms</h3><hr>

                        <p>Color platforms come in sets of two, with the first set consisting of primary colors and the second set
                            secondary colors. Only one platform in each set can be stood on. The corporeal platform in the first set
                            is based on the order of the colors from left to right:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red, Blue, Yellow: red</li>
                            <li>Blue, Yellow, Red: yellow</li>
                            <li>Yellow, Red, Blue: blue</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The correct platform for the second set is the combination of the colors of the two incorrect platforms
                            from the first set.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Moving Platforms</h3><hr>

                        <p>Moving platforms can only be stood on while they're moving a certain direction. This direction is based on
                            the correct platform from the first set of color platforms.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red: towards the right</li>
                            <li>Blue: towards the left</li>
                            <li>Yellow: towards the right</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Timer Platforms</h3><hr>

                        <p>Timer platforms are white platforms that span the width of the room and disappear a certain amount of
                            time after the player first touches them. There are two in each room. The amount of time each one takes
                            to disappear depends on the order of the first set of color platforms.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red, Blue, Yellow: the first platform takes 6 seconds, and the second takes 2 seconds</li>
                            <li>Blue, Yellow, Red: the first platform takes 5 seconds, and the second takes 4 seconds</li>
                            <li>Yellow, Red, Blue: the first platform takes 6 seconds, and the second takes 4 seconds</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Invisible Platforms</h3><hr>

                        <p>An invisible platform is present if there appears to be large gap between platforms that can't be crossed
                            with a jump. The location of this platform is based on the location of the corporeal color platform from
                            the first set. If the color platform was in the middle of the room, then the invisible platform is also
                            in the middle. Otherwise, it is on the opposite side of the room.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Code Platforms</h3><hr>

                        <p>Code platforms are long gray platforms that appear at the end of platform rooms. They are identical in every
                            way, but only one can be stood on. The correct platform can be determined by subtracting the duration of
                            the second timer platform from the first. The result is equal to the number of platforms away from the wall
                            the correct platform is. Count in the direction that the moving platform moves while corporeal.
                        </p>
