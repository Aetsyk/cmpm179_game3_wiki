                    <div>
                        <p>Maze Rooms are mazes with various traps. There are three maze layouts in total, each with
                            three possible spawn points and a single exit. Taking the wrong path can lead to triggering a trap.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Finding the Player's Location</h3><hr>

                        <p>Figuring out which maze the player is in can be done using the geometry of the starting position.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>Spawn Point with Multiple Paths</h4>
                        <p>If there are multiple directions to move in on spawn, then the player can only be in Maze 1. If they
                            spawn in the middle of a hall with a visible dead end on one side, then they are at Spawn 1. If There
                            are three visible paths, then they are at Spawn 2.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Spawn Point with a Single Path that Curves Left</h4>
                        <p>If there is only one path to take and it curves left, the player is either in Maze 2 or Maze 3. If the
                            path immediately curves left and then right, then the player is in Maze 2 Spawn 3. If they have to turn
                            180 degrees at the curve, they are at one of the other spawn points. If they have to turn left again, they
                            are in Maze 2 Spawn 1. Otherwise, the player is in Maze 3, and they need to move to the first split to
                            know which spawn they started at. This split will have a path forward and a path to the right. If the path
                            forward curves to the right, they started at Spawn 1. If it curves to the left, they started at Spawn 2.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Spawn Point with a Single Path that Curves Right</h4>
                        <p>If there is one path that curves right, the player could be in any maze, but each maze only has one
                            spawn point that matches this description. If there is a left turn after the first right, then the player
                            is in Maze 1 Spawn 3. If there is a split after the first right, the player is in Maze 2 Spawn 2. If the
                            first right is a 180 degree turn leading to a left, the player is in Maze 3 Spawn 3.

                        <h3>Navigating Maze Rooms</h3><hr>

                        <p>Finding the exit in a Maze Room involves a lot of trial and error. When the exact spawn point in the maze
                            is known, finding the exit is much easier. The following guides can be used to find the exit.</p>
